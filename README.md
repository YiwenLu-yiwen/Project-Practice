## Project Description
__Background:__ There is a lot of land development going around Victoria with new estates emerging in most outer suburbs. Some of the property developers in these emerging suburbs provide monetary incentives to first homeowners to complete the front landscaping within 3 months. Given short deadlines and the expenses of moving into a new property, most homeowners decide to work on the garden as a DIY project instead of enlisting the assistance of a professional. The users would at times receive conflicting information depending on who they speak to. The suggestions provided by the different sources might not address all key considerations, lacking in structure, evidence and is prone to human bias.  The novice gardener being completely new to the concept of gardening would require a more guided approach to assist with maintenance.

__The problem:__ A new homeowner in Victoria who has no experience in gardening, who wishes to work on the landscaping of his property must find the most appropriate plants for his home garden but is overwhelmed by all the factors that should be considered in selecting the right plants and is also unsure of how to successfully care for these plants.

__The challenge:__
    *   Lack of awareness of the cultural and socio-economic value of plant conservation.
    *   Less knowledge about the biology of endangered plant species and their conservation actions.
    *    Widespread land clearing and, anthropogenically -driven habitat fragmentation, invasive species, introduced diseases, inappropriate fire regimes, and climate

__Our Solution:__ Based on the information from the questionnaire the user has populated, Plant recommendation Algorithm would provide results of plants that would suit the user’s requirements. Moreover, Plant Lifecycle Management would source information from a weather API and compute when the plant requires watering and send reminders to the user’s mobile. Additionally, Floral Analytic System will provide interesting facts on the plants that the user enters into their journal.
